MVP OSM: a tool that allows to individuate the areas of high activity in openstreetmap based on level of detail

By observing the world map which is drawn on OpenStreetMap, it is relatively easy to realize which areas are higher in community activities and which are more marginal.
The high level of details certainly can be considered as a good
indicator of quality of OSM data in a zone
OpenStreetMap's success in the world has meant that the contributions
the map are now so many that, at present, even without a GPS, anyone can make a contribution (or through tracing activities, or by importing data, or by adding destination information retrieved from other data sources ...).
The map becomes increasingly rich, but often the concept of quality of data is questioned.
MVP OSM wants to highlight areas wherethe osmers dedicate attention to detail, which is strongly required the use of a GPS or at least a deep knowledge of the area and consequent desire to see it best represented.
The input is a file. osm, which is converted by python in a file spatialite (the gis extension for sqlite) and then processed for create clusters, which are then derive the activity of a single or multiple users on the area by create vector gis and heatmaps

REQUIREMENTS:
* python >2.7
* spatialite >2.4
* spatialite-tool (spatialite_osm_raw)
* numpy

HOW USE
1. extract a small area with a .osm file
ex. 
wget http://download.gfoss.it/osm/osm/regioni/trentino_alto_adige.osm.bz2
bunzip trentino_adige_osm.bz2
2. convert it with spatialite_osm_raw
ex. spatialite_osm_raw
spatialite_osm_raw -o trentino_alto_adige_osm -d trentino_alto_adige.sqlite
3. lunch the script
python mvp.py -i trentino_alto_adige.osm -o trentino_alto_adige.sqlite
